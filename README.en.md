LibraDemosChain core project – decentralized democratic governance platform.

---

## 🚀 Vision & Objectives

LibraDemosChain aims to revolutionize global democracy by creating a decentralized, transparent, and accessible governance system. Inspired by Bitcoin, the project goes further: every citizen can participate directly, without intermediaries, thanks to blockchain, AI, and advanced privacy.

- **Multi-blockchain**: Modular architecture, integration of privacy-oriented blockchains (Anoma, Namada, ZK, etc.) and high-performance chains (Solana, Polygon, Ethereum…)
- **AI for governance (NEOMA)**: Anti-disinformation, proposal analysis, smart moderation
- **ZK-KYC & Privacy Stack**: Zero-knowledge proofs, identity and anonymous voting management
- **Phased deployment**: National (France) → Continental (Europe) → Global

## 🛠 Practical Guides

- [Deploying a CosmWasm smart contract](docs/howto_deploy_contract.md)
- [Node initialization & genesis configuration](docs/INSTALLATION.md)
- [IBC connection & interoperability](blockchain/x/multichain/README.md)
- [Using advanced modules (privacy, AI, DAO, KYC)](docs/STRUCTURE_IDEALE.md)

---

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- Regular audits (CertiK, Quantstamp, penetration tests, formal ZK verification)
- Key management (HSM, keyring-backend, mnemonic backup)
- Linting, formatting, test coverage (see SECURITY.md)

---

## 💰 Dual-Token Tokenomics

- **LDC**: Governance token (1 citizen = 1 vote, 0.5% burn rate per vote)
- **NEO**: Rewards for citizen engagement (fact-checking, contributions, anti-disinformation)

---

## 📈 Monitoring, Observability, Testnets

- Prometheus monitoring, REST/gRPC APIs, detailed logs
- Testnet guide: [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md), [blockchain/x/multichain/README.md](blockchain/x/multichain/README.md)
