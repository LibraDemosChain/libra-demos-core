# 01 - Blockchain & Cryptography

[ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Version franÃ§aise](./README.md)

*Priority: High*
**Key Role**: Technical architecture, security, and privacy foundations of LibraDemosChain.

---

## Overview
This domain covers the blockchain infrastructure and cryptographic protocols that ensure LibraDemosChain's decentralization, immutability, and privacy. It integrates Cosmos SDK for governance, Anoma/Namada for privacy, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for anonymous participation.

## Key Skills & Applications

### 1. **Blockchain Development**
- **Cosmos SDK**: Build modular governance DAOs (e.g., `LDC-FR-Paris-14` sub-DAOs) with Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).
- **Anoma/Namada**: Privacy-focused transactions and shielded voting.
- **Smart Contracts**: Rust-based contracts for proposal management and tokenomics.
- **Tools**: Rust, Go, CosmWasm, Namada CLI.

### 2. **Zero-Knowledge Cryptography**
- **ZK-SNARKs/STARKs**: Anonymous voting via proofs of valid participation (e.g., ZK-KYC).
- **Poseidon Hash**: Optimized for ZKP circuits in voting systems.
- **Circom**: Circuit design for ZK-proofs (e.g., proving citizenship without revealing identity).
- **Tools**: Circom, Arkworks, R1CS libraries.

### 3. **Security & Resilience**
- **Consensus Security**: Mitigate 51% attacks via Tendermint PoS.
- **Sybil Resistance**: Proof-of-Personhood with biometric or social attestations.
- **Key Management**: Multi-signature wallets (e.g., `gnosis-safe`) and social recovery.
- **Tools**: Slither, Mythril, CertiK audit templates.

### 4. **Decentralized Storage**
- **Arweave**: Permanent archival of governance proposals and votes.
- **IPFS**: Immutable content addressing for transparency.
- **Tools**: Bundlr (Arweave), IPFS-Cluster.
